### Hi, I'm Martin ðŸ‘‹
I am a Software Engineer working mainly with Android, Kotlin and Java.  

I like to investigate new technologies and try them out. I've been around computers and smartphones since I was 12 years old and I've always found it interesting.  

That's why my career is focused on software development.
